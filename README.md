2. For merkle_tree tests
    ```
    python -m unittest test_merkle_tree.py
    ```
    in command line.

## module merkle_tree.py
- create a merkle tree
- calculate proof-of-inclusion for a value at an index
- verify proof-of-inclusion given the value, the index, the proof and the root

- update a value of the merkle tree [in progress]
